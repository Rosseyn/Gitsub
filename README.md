# Gitsub
For now this simply runs in the parent module directory and syncs the parent module and then all of the submodules.

This util is meant to be run on the command line, to install use the following command:

```
npm install -g gitsub
```

Now you can navigate to a directory containing a parent repo and run the command ```gitsub```.
